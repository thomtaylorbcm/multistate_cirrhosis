# multistate_cirrhosis
This repository contains Risk Profiling Application (RPA) for modeling forward progression through states of liver disease, including development of Ascities, Hepatic Encephalopathy, Varicael Bleeding, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and Death, 

## Description
### Modeling Context
This model is based on a cohort of patients with confirmed cirrhosis who are followed through time in care within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration health care systems. Further details of the project, data extration, and data characterization are available at at the [VA HSR&D 
Project Website](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/research/abstracts.cfm?Project_ID=2141706339). This resource contains papers and publications emanating from this project.

### Data Sources
The data source for all analyses is the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Data are not publicly available. 

### Analyses
Analyses and exact cohort details are currently in the manuscript preparation phase. However, currently, a large 8 state, 22 transition model is the source for this Risk Profiling Application (RPA). The ![forward progression](https://github.com/thomtaylorbcm/multistate_cirrhosis/assets/158203493/f2106c9f-4806-4414-979a-bf7cf8478d04")

Python Plotly and Dash are the primary APIs used for risk profiling.
